# HugoBot
All things involved in building the HugoBot.

## Next steps:
- Add orintation tracking
    [BNO085 breakout 9DOF](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4754)
- Add Optical Flow Sensor
    [PIM453:PMW3901 based board](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Pimoroni/PIM453?qs=PzGy0jfpSMuJnlsymXyulA%3D%3D)
- Add NEOPixel light ring as and indicator,
- LCD to show distance traveled and deltaV.

Use the PIM453 to track delta X and delta Y for position tracking.

Use the BNO085, and set the direction of the end goal.

Maybe this would be a good thing for JimBot as well.
